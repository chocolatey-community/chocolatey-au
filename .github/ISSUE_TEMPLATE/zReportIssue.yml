        Ensure you have read over [Submitting Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/.github/blob/main/SUBMITTING-ISSUES.md) and you are opening this issue in the correct repository.

        Please check to see if your problem already exists with a quick search of the issues. Start with one relevant term and then add others if you get too many results.

        **NOTE: Keep in mind we have a [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/chocolatey/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community.**

        Name your issue appropriately: give it a sentence that reads well enough for anyone seeing this in the release notes to know what it is.

        When writing out the issue details, please ensure you are writing it as if you were explaining it to somebody else, even if you will be working on and resolving the issue yourself.
        This helps others to understand the reasons for the issue and for it to be searchable in the future.

        Please include a complete set of _reproducible steps_ that another user or maintainer of the repository can follow to get the same behavior that you are seeing. _Reproducible steps_ should allow _anybody_ who is unfamiliar with your issue or environment to be able to reproduce your issue. This may include code, scripts or other environment configuration.

        **NOTE: We are unlikely to be able to troubleshoot or respond to issues without _reproducible steps_. If you do not complete this section with _reproducible steps_, the issue will be closed.**

        1. I ran this command `choco source list`
        2. No sources were displayed
        3. I then ran this command `choco blah`
        4. etc.

        Please include as many details about your system as possible. Sometimes, a problem may only happen on specific systems, and this information can be vital to resolving your issue.

        At a minimum, include the following pieces of information:
        We assume you are using Windows PowerShell, and all example commands given should be run in Windows PowerShell, not in PowerShell Core or CMD.

        * Operating System: To get this information run `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.version.tostring()`
        * Windows PowerShell Version: Run `$PSVersionTable`
        * Chocolatey CLI Version: Run `choco --version`
        * Chocolatey Licensed Extension version (Run `choco list chocolatey.extension --exact` (If running a Chocolatey CLI version less than v2.0.0, add `--local-only`)):
        * Chocolatey License type (Professional / Business / ?)
        * Terminal/Emulator: Some knowledge from you is necessary here. CMD, Windows PowerShell, PowerShell Core, Microsoft Terminal, Cmder, and more are possible known terminals or emulators.

        Sometimes one or more packages installed may be the cause of the problem. Please include the information from the command `choco list ` (If running a Chocolatey CLI version less than v2.0.0, add `--local-only`). If this is part of the installation of Chocolatey CLI or no packages
        are installed (not even Chocolatey); please add `N/A` instead.

      description: |
        Please include the log given by Chocolatey CLI when running in debugging and verbose mode. You can run Chocolatey CLI in debugging and verbose mode using the flags `--debug --verbose`. Alternatively, you can find the log file in the following default location: `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log`.

        Before including the output log, make sure of the following:
        - There is no sensitive data shared in the log.
        - We need ALL OUTPUT, not just what you may believe is relevant.
        - We need ALL OUTPUT (including the configuration information). See https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/b1300b91c167c8ac8205#file-error-txt-L1-L41 for what we need.
        - If it is hard to reproduce with debug/verbose, the log file already logs with those parameters. Just grab the relevant section from the log file.
        - Preferably link to a gist instead of pasting the entire log in the issue. You can create a new gist here: https://gist.github.com/ (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists).
